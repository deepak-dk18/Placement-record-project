System Overview:

      The current system faces challenges in managing student's placement records efficiently. 
      This results in inconvenience due to unorganized data. 
      To streamline this process, a centralized forum is needed for students to upload their internship.
      And job offer letters, ensuring easy access and management of placement records.

     
      ● Inconsistent Record-Keeping: 
            Different departments manage placement offers without a unified system, leading to duplication of records and inconsistent data management.

      ● Information Overload: 
            The placement team and students face difficulties due to the sheer volume of documentation and communication required for each placement offer, which often results in important details being overlooked or lost.

      ● Fragmented Access to Information: 
            Critical data about student placements is scattered across different departments, making it challenging for Placement team to access and utilize the information efficiently.

      ● Administrative Overhead: 
            The current system requires extensive manual effort to manage and verify placement data, imposing a significant burden on administrative staff and detracting from their ability to perform other critical tasks.



Workflow:
      ● User Login: Users and admin log in using their provided credentials.
